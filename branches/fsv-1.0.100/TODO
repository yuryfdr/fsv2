*** from old TODO ***

* Rewrite the MapV layout algorithm. Currently, it works, but doesn't
generate very optimal layouts-- some nodes are too wide, some too tall,
and the ones in the frontmost row/rows invariably turn out paper-thin.

* Implement a somewhat smarter node pointing/selection handler for faraway
nodes (e.g. when in bird's-eye view mode). Right now, it gives you exactly
the node that is under the cursor's hotspot-- even if it's so small you
can barely see it. fsv should instead return an ancestor node, that is
larger than a set pixel-based minimum.

* Implement a better way of bringing up the online help.
