*** from old TODO ***

* Rewrite the MapV layout algorithm. Currently, it works, but doesn't
generate very optimal layouts-- some nodes are too wide, some too tall,
and the ones in the frontmost row/rows invariably turn out paper-thin.

I've discussed an alternate approach with a friend of mine (hi Louis!),
one heuristically based that would run slightly slower but give much
better (even if not provably optimal) solutions. I'm definitely open to
ideas here. It's a rather tricky CS problem.

* Implement a somewhat smarter node pointing/selection handler for faraway
nodes (e.g. when in bird's-eye view mode). Right now, it gives you exactly
the node that is under the cursor's hotspot-- even if it's so small you
can barely see it. fsv should instead return an ancestor node, that is
larger than a set pixel-based minimum.

* Implement a better way of bringing up the online help. I'm almost
embarrassed by the cheap /bin/sh hack currently employed :] (Not to
mention it leaves zombie processes hanging around until the main program
terminates-- bad bad bad!)
